Ecchoice (stylized **ecch**o**i**ce) is an app that _picks a poison_ suited to your tastes by using
an alternative approach to the traditional "nearest neighbor" algorithm by selecting the "farthest
neighbor" to the user's disliked items.

This is a work in progress and aims to be a proof of concept for a more general approach to
recommendation systems.
